Our conductor gave each of us this printed verse on a small note, asking us to sing it in our heads during the trio section. The march, dedicated \"to collegians, past, present, and future,\" is vivid, hopeful, and radiantly happy. It depicts my fantasy for college, with he declaration that goes with Shakespeare's line \"The world is your oyster\", and the spirit that goes with the song \"Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now\". "

      "content": "But my campus life turned out different. It's not as cheerful, not as carefree, not as bright — it's a little more lonely, a little more chaotic, a little more about feeling lost. And these feelings are authentic. They pulled me out of my illusions about college, yet they're not sad in the way those adjectives might suggest. They're simply real. And if you sit down and look closely, you'll find a different kind of happiness — something more sophisticated, more subtle than the march's exuberance."

      "content": "On the campus, my stories are usually attached to random outdoor walks, casual chats with a few friends, or simply those quiet hours of immersive study. They're often not particularly interesting, but as the protagonist of these stories, I'm fascinated by stepping out of the frame and looking back, trying to revive all those moments. This is why campus remains such a compelling setting for me — not just because it's close to my life right now, but because it provides a shelter where all kinds of feelings can reveal themselves."
